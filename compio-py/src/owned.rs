//! Thread-safe cell with single-owner access control and reference counting.
//!
//! This module provides `OwnedRefCell<T>`, which combines lazy initialization with
//! exclusive ownership semantics. At any given time, at most one thread "owns" the
//! cell and can access its contents. The owning thread can hold multiple references
//! simultaneously through reference counting.
//!
//! This module is inspired by:
//!  * `std::cell::RefCell` for interior mutability and reference counting
//!  * `std::cell::OnceCell` for lazy initialization

/// guarantees:
///
/// - **Single ownership**: At most one thread can own the cell at any time
/// - **Reference counting**: The owning thread can create multiple `Ref` instances
/// - **Reentrant control**: Callers can specify whether reentrant access is allowed
/// - **Lazy initialization**: The value can be initialized exactly once after creation
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// The cell is `Sync` when `T: Send`. The `owner` atomic ensures exclusive ownership,
/// while the `borrow` counter tracks active references from the owning thread. Since
/// only the owning thread can access `borrow` (protected by the `owner` lock), using
/// a non-atomic `Cell` is sound and more efficient than `AtomicUsize`.

/// let cell = OwnedRefCell::default();

/// // Initialize the cell
/// cell.init(42).unwrap();
///
/// // Get a reference (allows reentrant access)
/// let ref1 = cell.get().unwrap().unwrap();
